# Instructions for Contributors
- The initial designs are organized into one folder.
- New designs should be added to the [main.circ](./main_designs/main.circ) in the [main_designs](./main_designs/) directory.
- The main.circ Logisim file has sub-circuits for ALU, register_file, CU.
- We'll do all our circuit designs in there.
- Let's get to work
